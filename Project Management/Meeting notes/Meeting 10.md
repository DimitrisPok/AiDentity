## Meeting notes
- Model: 
    - Looked into the transfer learning, i.e, using a pre-trained model, for a higher accuracy and the time it takes too long.  
    - facial Landmarks to preprocess the images on, so regardless of what images are being sent, they will be realigned to process. 
    - Sent an email to check if the transfer learning is enough for a 5, or need to change/do more. 
- Finalize data augmentation approach and check accuracy of model. 

- Backend:
    - Most of the Admin and user backend methods were completed and tested using curl.
    - saved the model into a file 
    - Retrain the model 

- Frontend:
    - Homepage structure and basics is done 

- Git:
    - Add issue number at the start of the commit message
    - The commit message should be formulated as follows: This commit [commit message]
        - Example: #16 Updates admin methods
- Question for TA:
    - Dynamic retraining requirement, would the admin submitting a new batch of data (which retrains the model) satisfy this requirement?
