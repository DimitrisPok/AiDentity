## Meeting notes
- A transfer learning model has been implemented using efficient net and has an accuracy of 94,5%
    - Thus we decided to use this model instead of vgg16 as its more computationally efficient and has a better accuracy
- We decided to restructure our model pipeline using sklearn
- Testing and deployment is still ongoing and is working well so far
- The FDD was updated 
- Backend and Frontend has been containerized and has been deployed locally
