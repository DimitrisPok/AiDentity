## Meeting notes
- We decided to change the scope of the project from using the tool for criminal identification to border security
    - Classifying criminals is unethical as we do not have a dataset that contains criminals and non-criminals, thus we would be misclassifying real people as criminals
- Component diagram
    - We decided to make a component diagram to get an overview of the system design
- The project planning has been started
    - Project management plan:
